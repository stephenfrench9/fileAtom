Basic android file operations. Save to internal and external directories.

If I want to save text or an image, how do I do that?

Well, they are specfic directories on the phone which you use. Certain libraries provide 
you with the addresses of those directories. Many of the directories have an intended use. 
You might have to ask permission to access certain directories from your app. Some directories 
may become unavailable at times (if the user accesses it from his/her computer). Some directories
are never visible to the user.
